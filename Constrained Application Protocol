The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.[1]

The CoRE group has designed CoAP with the following features in mind:

    Overhead and parsing complexity.
    URI and content-type support.
    Support for the discovery of resources provided by known CoAP services.
    Simple subscription for a resource, and resulting push notifications.
    Simple caching based on max-age.

The mapping of CoAP with HTTP is also defined, allowing proxies to be built providing access to CoAP resources via HTTP in a uniform way.[3]

With the introduction of CoAP, a complete networking stack of open-standard protocols that are suitable for constrained devices and environments becomes available.[4]

From the architecture point of view, the CoAP server will be installed on the end node, which could be a sensor. On the other hand, the CoAP client should be installed on the controller, which manages several end nodes.
